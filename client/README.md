# ATOMIC-REACT-REDUX

This boilerplate uses atomic design by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/) for [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps. This solution for developers who want use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The best boilerplate with webpack you can find [here](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc).

## Requirements

The project uses `npm`. Before using the application you should download and install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node.js uses `npm` by default.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find `git` [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

```
$ node --version
v10.15.3
```

```
$ npm --version
6.4.1
```

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

```
$ npm install npm -g
```

## Get started

To get started you can simply clone the repository:

```
$ https://github.com/Furmanov19/atomic-react-redux.git
```

After that you are able to install all requirement dependencies. Just do it:

```
$ npm install
```

You are done with installation. Good job!

## Running the project

Just write the next command from root folder:

```
$ npm start
```

## Running the tests

You can _run_ tests with some options:

```
$ npm run test /* to start tests once*/
$ npm run test:watch /* to start tests in watch mode. It means that test will fire on every changes in files*/
$ npm run test:update /* to update snapshots*/
$ npm run test:coverage /* to see code coverage by tests*/
```

## Simple build for production

You can _build_ the application with:

```
$ npm build
```
